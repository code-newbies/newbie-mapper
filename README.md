# JavaScript Enabled's NewbieMapper

This is the project for the CodeNewbie JavaScript Enabled group. You can join the group [here](https://codenewbie.typeform.com/to/uwsWlZ). To get started, read the following, and if you get stuck, reach out to [Dan Berger](http://twitter.com/dsberger), the host.

### About this project

We are building a hangman game to help us develop our JavaScript skills. We meet weekly [here](https://codenewbie.typeform.com/to/uwsWlZ) in the "js-enabled" channel on Thursday at 9PM EST, so mark your calendars and stop by! There, we'll review the project, look at code together, and share what we learned.

In particular, we hope to:

- collaborate and learn together
- turn feature requirements into actual product features!
- get code reviewed by community members
- get experience working on a real app in a collaborative, real-world setting

## Getting Started

Here's what you need to know to get started with our project.

### git (and Github)

You'll need a Github account and some knowledge of git. If you're not comfortable using git, that's perfectly fine! Start by looking at the following resources:

- [Github For Beginners: Don't Get Scared, Get Started](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1)
An incredibly newbie-friendly introduction to the world of git and Github. Written by a non-developer, it's a great introduction to many of the common terms and concepts.

- [Github For Beginners: Commit, Push and Go](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2)
Part two of the above article, this post takes you through setting up a git repo and performing common commands in your repo. Open up your terminal and follow along to get the most out of this post.

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
This course from Code School lets you try  git from the browser. It's an easy way to practice the commands you'll use for the JavaScript Tuesday project.

- [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
We'll be using the Feature Branch Workflow for these projects. This is a great blog post filled with awesome diagrams that show you how it works. Once you've familiarized yourself with git and Github, read through this to see how we'll use it in this collaborative setting.

- **Have more git questions?** If you've gone through the material above and want to walk through git concepts with a real person, send us a note <hello@codenewbie.org> and we'd be happy to setup some time to do it together.

### JavaScript
You're welcome to start contributing at any level, but it's helpful to have some knowledge of JavaScript. To get you started go through the following tutorials first.

- [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/), a lighthearted introduction to JS that the author estimates should take about 2 hours.
- [Codecademy's JavaScript Track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript), which has many applied lessons and should take about 10 hours of work according to their estimate.

Once you're done, come back and get your code on!

There's a big gap between the knowledge you gain when you go through the tutorials, and the skills you need to be job ready. We hope to help fill that gap by working on collaborative projects like this. So if you're tired of doing tutorials and you're looking for some real-world experience, this is for you.

### React.js
NEED CORE CURRICULUM FOR REACT

### How to contribute
We use pull requests so you can get your code reviewed by others before merging it into the project. Code reviews are a great way to learn and collaborate. Here's how the process works:

1. Join our [Slack community][1] and tell your host (dsberger on Slack, Twitter and Github) that you want to join the project repo.
2. The host will invite you to join as a collaborator. You **MUST** be a collaborator to join the project and pick up features.
3. Accept invite from Github and Trello to join as a collaborator.
4. Look at [our Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Y00YIqJm/newbie-mapper-js-enabled) to find an issue in "Up Next" that doesn't have anyone working on it.
- Assign that feature to yourself.
- Clone this repo.
- Make a feature branch for the issue you're working on. The first part of the branch name should be your initials, like this: `sy-allows-users-to-update-avatar`.
- Push your branch to origin.
- When your feature is done and ready to be reviewed, make pull request.
- Copy and paste your pull request link to the 'js-tuesday' Slack channel for review.
- Once you get some feedback on your pull request and a final thumbs up from a community member, merge to master & the close branch.

### Come to JavaScript Enabled!
Join us at 9PM EST on Thursday to review code and talk about the project. Come with questions, code to show, and be ready to share what you're learning!

## Community rules & guidelines
The purpose of this project is to learn by working on a real-world application. Use the code reviews as a place to ask questions, offer suggestions, and share your thoughts. When giving feedback, particularly on code reviews, please remember our community rules: be nice, be honest, be supportive. We're all learning, so let's make sure to be kind to one another.

For more details, see our full [Code of Conduct](http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/our-code-of-conduct). We're excited to learn with you :)
